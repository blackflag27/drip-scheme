# drip-scheme
Drip Scheme is a dialect of Scheme that supports R5RS, and Small R7RS. The eventual goal is to include a language called Drippy that compiles to Drip that has C-style syntax. Eventually it should support the following backends: (LLVM, JVM, Z80, C++, Javascript, Haxe, Parrot VM, and Lua). Another wishlist item is stalin style optimizations, and chicken/gambit srfis and extensions. It is also designed to be used with an absolutely disgusting preprocessor called Yellow, which combines the c preprocessor, m4, awk, and other unix text processing utilities.
