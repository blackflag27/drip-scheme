# drip-scheme
Drip Scheme is a dialect of Scheme that supports R5RS, and Small R7RS. The eventual goal is to include a language called Drippy that compiles to Drip that has C-style syntax. Eventually it should support the following backends: (LLVM, JVM, Z80, C++, Javascript, Haxe, Lua). Another wishlist item is stalin style optimizations, and chicken/gambit srfis and extensions.
